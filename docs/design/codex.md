# The Codex bot

Design notes for fool-bot; the map is [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md), the rules are [living-rules.md](../living-rules.md).

This repository runs two Discord bots. fool-bot plays D12 Ball; the
**Codex bot** plays Sirlin Games' *Codex: Card-Time Strategy*, starting
from the basic game -- one hero a side, Bashing (Troq Bashar) against
Finesse (River Montoya), the ten neutral starters as both decks, the
tower and the surplus as the only add-ons. It is modelled on the D12
Ball bot and built from [../codex-bot.md](../codex-bot.md), the
worksheet whose steps it is; this note is what those steps settled, one
section per decision as it lands.

Step 1 stood it up: the entry point, the shared bot class, the card
data and its import, `/codex card` and `/codex rules`, the runner. It
plays nothing yet. The model's purity rules hold for `codex/` from its
first commit (`tests/test_model_purity.py`): no `discord`, no
`async def`, Pillow only in `codex/render.py`, which a later step
writes.

**Nothing hidden is ever written where another player can read it** --
a hand, a deck's order, a discard pile's contents, an unanswered tech
choice, a hired worker's card: not into a public message, not into a
log line, not into the #logs mirror. Codex is a hidden-information game
and D12 Ball never was, so nothing in the shared code guards this for
it; every step that touches a hidden zone says in its PR where it
checked. In step 1 nothing hidden exists yet.

## Its own process, its own token

`codexbot.py` is its own process, beside `foolbot.py` and
`python3 -m webapp`, reading `CODEX_DISCORD_TOKEN` from the same `.env`,
with its own state file (`data/codex_bot_state.json`), its own pid and
logs, and -- from step 2 -- its own games file. Nothing is shared with
fool-bot at runtime (worksheet decision 1, the author's choice of
2026-10-07: a Codex cog inside fool-bot was not chosen, and would have
put one game's rate-limit buckets and crashes under the other's).

- **The name is a matcher argument.** `update_main_bot.ps1` finds every
  fool-bot by `foolbot\.py` in a process's command line and stops each
  one ("One bot per token" in [collaboration.md](collaboration.md)), so
  the entry point's name must not contain `foolbot.py`, or the updater
  would stop and count the Codex bot as a second fool-bot. `codexbot.py`
  does not; `run_codex_bot.ps1` matches `codexbot\.py`, which neither a
  foolbot nor `-m webapp` carries. Each script stops exactly its own.
- **The state file is its own because the keys are the same.**
  `data/bot_state.json` holds the command tree's fingerprint and the
  last build announced; two bots writing one file would each find the
  other's fingerprint there and re-sync their commands on every start,
  which is the rate-limited request the fingerprint exists to save.
- **The bot class is shared, not copied.** `gamebot.py` holds `GameBot`
  and the command-sync gate, moved out of `foolbot.py` with what
  `foolbot.py` hard-coded made parameters: the extensions, the state
  file, the variable that forces a sync (`FOOLBOT_COMMAND_SYNC`,
  `CODEX_COMMAND_SYNC`) and the message-content intent. fool-bot keeps
  the intent, which a game channel's export needs; the Codex bot is
  slash commands and buttons, so it asks for no privileged intent and
  there is one less switch in the Portal. `foolbot.py` keeps every name
  `tests/test_command_sync.py` patches, and its `GameBot` is a subclass
  passing today's values.
- **`botlog` is shared once it knows which bot it is.**
  `configure_logging(prefix, bot_name, state_file)`; the Codex bot's
  `CODEX_LOG_*` fall back to the `FOOLBOT_LOG_*` values, so one `.env`
  and one #logs channel serve both and every notice names its bot
  (the author, 2026-10-07; "Two bots read these" in
  [logging.md](logging.md)).
- **It carries no `/roll`, no coins and no Tethys deck** (the author,
  2026-10-08): one bot, one game.

## The cards are data

Every card's text, type, cost, stats and tech level, every hero's three
bands, and Sirlin's rulings come from the Codex Card Database's
repository, `rgdelato/codex-cards-gatsby`, through
`scripts/import_codex_cards.py`, and nothing else (worksheet decision
6). The rule is `d12ball/data/`'s: **regenerated whole, never edited by
hand, the import the only way** -- each file's header says so and names
its source.

- **The source is pinned.** The script fetches the ten `raw_data` files
  at the commit in `SOURCE_SHA` (`10f8952`, the repository's master on
  2026-10-08 -- its last commit is of 2019), so a re-import is the same
  import until somebody moves the pin on purpose; `--offline <dir>`
  reads the same files from a checkout and writes the same output.
- **All of it comes in at once**: 310 cards, 22 tokens, 8 buildings, the
  two worker cards (four workers and five) and 20 heroes, so a later spec is code, not data. A
  record has a `kind` -- `card`, `token`, `building`, `worker` -- read
  from its starting zone. Two records with one name collapse to the
  first: a token's two printed faces, and each colour's copy of the
  worker card, which differ only in their colour.
- **A card is keyed by its slug** and never held or compared by its
  name; `CardCatalog.name` is the one way back, for wording alone. The
  slug is the database's own (`toSlug` in its `createCardJSONData.js`):
  lowercase, whitespace to `_`, every other non-word character dropped
  -- `trojan_duck`, and `regularsized_rhinoceros` for
  "Regular-sized Rhinoceros", which is the database's page address.
- **The glyphs become tokens** the way `codex/tokens.py` reads them: ⤵
  `{exhaust}`, ◎ `{target}`, ① ② ... `{gold:n}`, → `{arrow}`. The
  model writes tokens and the cog renders them at its door
  (`cogs.codex_helpers.CodexTokens`), as D12 Ball's do; nothing else in
  the text is reworded. `{codex}` is the bot's own mark.
- **The rulings are the official rules of the game** (the author,
  2026-10-08). `codex/rulings.py` reads them -- `rulings_for(slug)` for a
  card's, `keyword_rulings(keyword)` for the `General` group's -- each
  with its author and date. A ruling that names two records ("Dancer /
  Angry Dancer") rules on each. Where the rulebook's text and a ruling
  differ, the ruling governs.
- **The copyright question** was the author's, answered on 2026-10-07:
  the texts, the rulings and the art are Sirlin Games' words and
  pictures, reproduced in this public repository as the fan database
  and the Screentop module reproduce them. The alternatives set aside
  were the facts alone in the tree with the prose fetched per checkout,
  the bot speaking only in its own words, and a private home for the
  prose.

**The art comes in the same run, and the author ran it** (2026-10-08,
on the Mac). The session that wrote step 1 could reach the card data
but neither image host, so the author imports the art where both
answer, and commits it; a session finishes the rest from what was
committed. Two sources:

- **The cards' own pictures**: each card's and hero's, by its
  `sirlins_filename`, from `codexcards-assets.surge.sh` into
  `codex/images/cards/<slug>.jpg`, 330 by 450 -- all 330 the host has.
  `.gitignore`'s old, unanchored `cards/` (for print output that used
  to land in a folder of that name) matched this folder too, and
  `git add` skips an ignored file without a word, so the first commit of
  the art carried none of the pictures; a negation for
  `codex/images/cards/` beside it is what lets them in.
- **The Screentop module's sheets** (@GRAG/Codex, whose spec one
  GraphQL query to `api.screentop.gg` returns with every sheet's URL):
  the playmat whole as `codex/images/board/playmat.png`, and seven
  sheets kept whole under `codex/images/board/sheets/` as the source
  their pieces are cut from. **The cells are pinned in `BOARD_SHEETS`**,
  each from one look at the sheet: a grid per sheet, and each piece's
  index -- or its index and a quarter turn, for the tiles and spec
  cards the sheet stores on their side, so they read upright as the
  playmat prints them. `--cut-only` cuts them again from the committed
  sheets with no network, so a change to a pin is made and checked
  anywhere.

What is under `codex/images/board/`, and what each is named by:

| Folder | What | Named by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `playmat.png` | One player's mat: the hero slots, the five patrol slots with their bonuses, the add-on slot, the base and the Tech I to III places, the workers, the discard and the draw | -- |
| `buildings/` | The base and the three tech buildings as tiles, the four add-ons as cards | the building's slug |
| `tokens/` | All 22 tokens' faces, two printed under another name: "Ghost" is `daigo_stormborne`, "Elemental" `water_elemental` | the token's slug |
| `specs/` | The twenty spec cards | the spec, as a slug |
| `backs/` | `card`, `hero`, `token` | -- |
| `patrol/` | The five slots' icons, white on the module's blue; the first printed "Patrol Leader", the rulebook's squad leader | the slot |
| `damage/`, `levels/`, `time_runes/` | Damage 1 to 9; a hero's level 2 to 8 and `max`; time runes 1 to 6 | the number |
| `chits/` | Single counters: `damage_1`, `damage_3`, `level_1`, `levels_3`, `plus_rune`, `minus_rune`, `two_step` (the +2/+2 with two dancers), and a blue `swirl` and an orange `house` nobody has said the module's use of, named for what they show | what it shows |

Left uncut: the twelve maps, a variant the basic game does not play, and
the sheets' label cells, which the playmat prints. `Card.picture` is a
card's own art wherever there is one -- the database's picture, or a
token's or a building's face -- so `/codex card dancer` and `/codex card
tower` answer with theirs; the worker card alone has none.

**The emoji are drawn here and uploaded by hand.** Application emoji
belong to one application and there is no upload code, so
`scripts/render_codex_emoji.py` draws `gold`, `exhaust` and `target`
into `codex/images/emoji/` (the heroes' two faces once their art is
imported), `codex.png` is the medallion cut from the module's card back,
and the author uploads each to the Codex application under its file's
name. `CodexTokens` picks each up by that name and shows a word until
it is there.

## The reference commands

`/codex card <name>` answers in the channel with the card's picture
attached, and under it, as plain text -- nothing in this bot is an
embed (the author, 2026-10-07) -- the name, the type line, the cost and
numbers (a hero's three bands), the text, Sirlin's rulings with their
authors and dates, and the database's page. `/codex rules <keyword>`
answers with a keyword's rulings as the official rules they are.
Both autocomplete (over every card and hero, and over the `General`
group's keywords) and both fit Discord's 2000 characters by counting the
rulings that do not fit and leaving them to the link, measured after
the tokens are rendered. No rulebook text is bundled and
`docs/living-rules.md` is not touched (worksheet decision 12).

## Running it

On the Mac, from the checkout, with `CODEX_DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env`:

```bash
python3 codexbot.py
python3 scripts/import_codex_cards.py      # re-import the cards and the art
python3 scripts/render_codex_emoji.py --in-place
```

On the live host, `scripts\run_codex_bot.cmd` restarts it and
`scripts\deploy.cmd` runs it straight after `update_main_bot` -- see
"The Codex bot" in [collaboration.md](collaboration.md). `CODEX_COMMAND_SYNC=force`
syncs the command tree regardless of the fingerprint, as
`FOOLBOT_COMMAND_SYNC` does for fool-bot.

There is **one Developer Portal application** for it, the live one,
created by the author on 2026-10-07, and **no test application**
(2026-10-08): a second application would need its own emoji uploaded
and its own invite for a bot that, in these steps, only two people
test. So one Codex bot runs at a time -- a session testing from the Mac
stops the live host's first, or runs before the live host runs one at
all.

# D12 Ball 2.0: the maneuver deck

Design notes for fool-bot; the map is [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md), the rules are
[rules-2.0.md](../rules-2.0.md) over [living-rules.md](../living-rules.md).

## An edition beside the mode

`D12BallGame.edition` (`Edition.ONE`, `Edition.TWO`) is a setting of its own, not a fourth
mode (the author, 2026-10-16: "keep d12ball 1.0 as is"; each mode keeps its abilities and
every mode can play the deck). **Nothing reads it to decide a rule**:
`RulesEngine.maneuver_deck_applies` is the answer, and it is never true for a tutorial, whose
beats rail cards a shuffled hand may not hold (`configure` refuses 2.0 there and
`pin_tutorial` sets 1.0).

- **`gambits_apply` answers yes in 2.0**, whatever the mode, because the deck holds the six
  advanced maneuvers and their successful and failed outcomes are rules of the cards. What 2.0
  drops is the coin, so **`coin_applies`** is the new gate over everything Law 19.3 adds:
  `coin_holder`, `may_declare_gambit`, `may_answer_gambit` (and with it `gambit_answer_owed`),
  `describe_gambit_access`, `withheld_gambits`, the declaration's refusal. Volatile's tier
  rider and the special abilities that raise a tier still ask `gambits_apply`: the advanced
  card exists in a 2.0 standard game.
- **The record leaves the field out of `to_dict` while it is 1.0**, as it does `ai_seats`, so a
  1.0 save is written byte for byte as before.
- **The rematch carries it**, in the service's `rematch` and the cog's.
- **Discord alone offers it**: two buttons on the mode's row of the lobby and the setup
  screen (`EDITION_BUTTONS`). The web table names the settings it shows and does not name this
  one, and `webapp.server` refuses it outright (`DISCORD_ONLY_SETTINGS`): the page has no
  secret hand. A web game is never 2.0.

## The deck is data on the match

`MatchState.maneuver_decks` is `{"home": deck, "visiting": deck}`, each deck `{"draw",
"hand", "discard"}` lists of **card ids**, saved as it stands. It is one of
`MATCH_EXPLICIT_FIELDS` rather than a row of the table, because **a match with no decks writes
no key**: every row of the table is in every save, and a 1.0 match has to be saved exactly as it
was before 2.0 -- the four goldens pin that byte for byte. An absent key reads as no decks,
which is 1.0 and every save before the field. `d12ball/maneuver_deck.py` is the cards and the three
moves made on them -- `new_deck`, `draw_cards`, `play_card` -- with the engine's `rng` handed
in, so a seeded game deals and reshuffles the same way every time.

- **A card is an id, not a maneuver.** A two-headed card is `basic_<rank>`, an advanced card
  its maneuver key. What a card plays is `plays_as(catalog, card, side)`, because a two-headed
  card is two maneuvers and the side decides which.
- **The deck belongs to a team, the pick to a maneuver side.** The engine maps one onto the
  other with `maneuver_side_team`, the reading every other per-side question already uses.
- **The reshuffle is at the last card drawn**, not at a draw from an empty pile -- the
  author's wording -- so a deck between turns is never empty while there is a discard.
- **The picks are still maneuver keys** on `offense_maneuver` / `defense_maneuver`; nothing in
  the effect pipeline knew there was a deck.

## Who holds what

**`RulesEngine.maneuver_hand` is still the only answer to which cards a coach may play.** In
2.0 it reads the side's team's hand through `plays_as` -- one entry a maneuver however many
copies are held -- and `maneuver_tiers` is read off it rather than the other way round. The
prompt's `ManeuverHand` keeps `maneuver_keys` as the answer, and grows `held` (the four card
ids) with `deck_count` and `discard_count`, which the AI and the pick refusal do not read. The
AI needed nothing: Dinky already picks among the keys on a rolled rank, and from the whole
hand where it holds nothing on that rank.

**An advanced card against no challenge resolves as its basic counterpart** (the author). It
is recorded as played, and `resolving_maneuver` downgrades it with no change, since
`cards_outcome` answers `None` with no opposing card; the uncontested narration says so.

## Played at the reveal

`d12ball.flow.turn.play_maneuver_cards`, at the end of `maneuver_pick_step` once
`maneuver_selections_complete`: the card behind each pick goes to the discard and the coach
draws to four. It is the reveal rather than `begin_effect_resolution` because that is when a
card is down for good -- until then the pick may change -- and the step where both picks
become complete is the one place every maneuver passes (an AI's pick goes through the same
answer). A reshuffle is said, since it is public.

## On Discord: the hand is secret

1.0's prompt puts both hands' buttons on one public message, which works because every coach
holds the same three cards. A 2.0 hand is a secret, so **the public prompt carries one button
a side and no card** (`d12ball:maneuver_hand:<game>:<side>`, `HAND_BUTTON_LABELS`), and no
hand image. Pressing it is gated as a pick is -- the coach of that side, or a helper -- and
answers ephemerally with the coach's four cards (`render_deck_hand`) and `ManeuverHandView`,
one button a playable maneuver. A pick from there is the 1.0 pick exactly
(`ManeuverPicking`, the mixin both views share): the same action, the same ephemeral "You
chose", the prompt deleted once both are in. The public message is never edited, as in 1.0,
and a restart re-arms it from the custom ids; the ephemeral hand is not persistent, and
pressing the public button again sends a fresh one.

**The cards are the printed ones.** A two-headed card (`render_two_headed_card`) is the
offensive and defensive card of its rank at half size, the side being played upright on top;
an advanced card of the other side is drawn veiled rather than left out, because it is still
in the hand. Each of the thirty faces is drawn once and kept.

What is not done yet: a 2.0 hand on the web page; a printed two-headed card for the
print-and-play kit; the Learn to Play.
